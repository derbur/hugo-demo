## Hugo
Hugo was my first attempt of the list of static sites. This was due to it claiming to be fast and easy to work with, (with Jekyll being a close second - or even an easier platform).
### Setup
The initial setup of Hugo is simple.

  1. Install Hugo: `brew install hugo`
  2. Create a new site: `hugo new site hugo-test`
  3. Move to the site's directory: `cd hugo-test`
  4. Run the site locally with drafts enabled: `hugo server -D`

Now we have a Hugo site up and running! ðŸš€

### Theming
For the Hugo blog I chose the [Codex theme](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex).
To add the theme to the site we just add the submodule to the `/themes` directory.

Add Codex theme: `git submodule add https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex.git themes/hugo-theme-codex`

To create/modify the homepage, we add a file called `_index.md` to the `/content` directory:
```
---
heading: "Hi, I'm Derrick"
subheading: "This is a place where I put things"
---
```
